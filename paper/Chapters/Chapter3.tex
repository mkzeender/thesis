\section{Diversity of Dwarf Sizes}

There are only so many conclusions we can draw about the diversity of dwarf sizes with the given data. The data from \cite{mcconnachieOBSERVEDPROPERTIESDWARF2012} spans the range of $10^2$ to $10^9$ solar masses, with many of the galaxies observed being smaller than $3 \cdot 10^6$. The FIREbox data, however, only covers galaxies greater than $3 \cdot 10^6$. Because of this, the lines of best fit defined by $\ln(a)$ and $\gamma$ (see equation \ref{equ:linear-rel}) for each dataset do not perfectly line up.
