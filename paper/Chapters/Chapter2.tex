\section{FIREbox Galaxy and Halo catalog}
Over the course of the simulated universe's evolution, 1201 snapshots of the state of the universe were collected (\cite{feldmannFIREboxSimulatingGalaxies2022}). They were approximately evenly spaced out in time and included the positions of the particles, their densities, metalicities, star-formation rates, and other properties. The particle data was reduced by grouping the particles into their respective galaxies and dark matter halos. They used the AMIGA Halo Finder (AHF; \cite{knollmannAhfAMIGAHALO2009}) to sort the halos into categories of halos and sub-halos, which in turn allowed them to categorize the galaxies by host and satellite galaxies respectively. The reduced data, known as the galaxy and halo catalog, includes galaxy information such as position, radius, mass, etc. as well as data about the dark matter halos around those galaxies.

        From: \cite{feldmannFIREboxSimulatingGalaxies2022}. A representation of the FIREbox simulation. The first two rows depict the state of the simulation at three different time points; the rightmost images depict the simulation in the present time. The top row depicts dark matter in blue and stellar matter in white, while the middle row depicts gas. The bottom row shows a galaxy at different scales within a cluster. As we can see, matter collects into galaxies and systems of galaxies over the course of the simulated universe's evolution. These galaxies take on a variety of sizes, and they share threads of gas and are contained within hierarchical halos of dark matter.

        From: \cite{salesBaryonicSolutionsChallenges2022}. A comparison of the sizes and masses of dwarf galaxies from simulations and reality. The y axis plots $r_{50}$ and the x axis plots $M_{50}$. The gray squares depict real galaxies from the Milky Way's local group, whose data was compiled by \cite{mcconnachieOBSERVEDPROPERTIESDWARF2012}. The other colors depict data from various simulations other than FIREbox. As we can see, the dwarfs from the local group show much diversity in their size-mass ratios. The simulated galaxies, however, show more consistency, especially when compared to others from their own simulation (for example, notice that the orange circles are all clustered together).
