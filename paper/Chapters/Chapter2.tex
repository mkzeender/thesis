\section{The Data}
Over the course of the evolution of the FIREbox simulation, 1201 snapshots of the state of the universe were collected (\cite{feldmannFIREboxSimulatingGalaxies2022}). They were approximately evenly spaced out in time and included the positions of the particles, their densities, metalicities, star-formation rates, and other properties. The particle data was reduced by grouping the particles into their respective galaxies and dark matter halos. They used the AMIGA Halo Finder (AHF; \cite{knollmannAhfAMIGAHALO2009}) to sort the halos into categories of halos and sub-halos, which in turn allowed them to categorize the galaxies by host and satellite galaxies respectively. The reduced data, known as the galaxy and halo catalog, includes galaxy information such as position, radius, mass and star formation rate, as well as data about the dark matter halos around those galaxies. For the extent of this experiment, we will be using the snapshot 1201, the final state of the simulation. This snapshot depicts the simulated present day.

Each parameter for the galaxies is split between a few different definitions. For the purpose of this experiment, we will use the following definitions unless otherwise specified. The galaxy's radius $R_{50}$ is defined to be the radius that contains 50\% of its stars, as determined by AHF. The galaxy's mass $M_*$ is defined to be the mass of the stars contained within $R_{50}$. We are not going to include dark matter in this definition. The reader should note that this is not the only way to define these parameters. Due to the fluid nature of matter on a galactic scale, it is often arbitrary as to whether a given particle belongs to a given galaxy. Alternate definitions include different thresholds for the radius, such as $R_{80}$, and different kinds of matter included in the mass, such as gas matter and dark matter.

Other parameters that we will use are a galaxy's position in space and its flyby distance---a satellite galaxy's minimum distance to its host galaxy. All distances (including radius) are measured in terms of the co-moving parameter $h$, a time-dependent scaling factor of the universe. In the final state of FIREbox, $h = 0.6774 kpc$. 

\cite{mcconnachieOBSERVEDPROPERTIESDWARF2012} compiled a number of data sets for dwarf galaxies in the local group of the Milky Way. One data set includes the galaxies' radii and another contains their mass. The radius is defined slightly differently in this case. It is the half-light radius, the radius from which half of the galaxy's light is emitted. The mass parameter is calculated by assuming a mass-light ratio of one, meaning that the brightness per unit mass is equal to the Sun. For the sake of this experiment, we will assume that the half-light radius is equal to $R_{50}$ the presumed $M_*$ is equal to $M_*$. To get this data in a usable form, I first dumped the text-based datasets into pandas spreadsheets. I removed invalid rows and then merged them by galaxy name. For galaxies whose names were reported differently on the different sheets, I merged them by hand. I then cast the mass and radius to float64 for use in the analysis.

The first two rows depict the state of the simulation at three different time points; the rightmost images depict the simulation in the present time. The top row depicts dark matter in blue and stellar matter in white, while the middle row depicts gas. The bottom row shows a galaxy at different scales within a cluster. As we can see, matter collects into galaxies and systems of galaxies over the course of the simulated universe's evolution. These galaxies take on a variety of sizes, and they share threads of gas and are contained within hierarchical halos of dark matter.

        From: \cite{salesBaryonicSolutionsChallenges2022}. A comparison of the sizes and masses of dwarf galaxies from simulations and reality. The y axis plots $r_{50}$ and the x axis plots $M_{50}$. The gray squares depict real galaxies from the Milky Way's local group, whose data was compiled by \cite{mcconnachieOBSERVEDPROPERTIESDWARF2012}. The other colors depict data from various simulations other than FIREbox. As we can see, the dwarfs from the local group show much diversity in their size-mass ratios. The simulated galaxies, however, show more consistency, especially when compared to others from their own simulation (for example, notice that the orange circles are all clustered together).

\section{The Diffusion Parameter}
As diffusion will be main subject of this paper, let us define it. The dwarf galaxies in FIREbox loosely follow a power law size-mass relationship (see figure \ref{fig:size-mass}). The relationship can therefore be described using the following equation.

\begin{equation}
    R_{50} = R_k
    \left(
        \frac{M_*}{M_\odot}
    \right)
    ^{\gamma}
    + E(\beta)
\end{equation}

Where $R_k$ and $\gamma$ are constants, $M_\odot$ is the mass of the sun, and $E(\beta)$ is a galaxy specific error term.
