I dedicate this to my good friend Ben Getchell. Your mind could move galaxies.

I am writing this while standing on the backs of giants. Thank you to my wonderful partner Maggie, who has been at my side throughout this entire process; from helping me with statistics to moral support to getting me water, I could not have done this without you. Thank you to my suitemates and to all my friends, you have stuck with me through late nights and and long uncommunicative periods. Thank you to my mom, dad, and sister for supporting me in my lifelong dream to study astrophysics, and for sending me to this school. Thank you to the Pomona college faculty and staff; they work tirelessly to ensure the success and wellbeing of us students. A special thanks to Professor Whitaker, my academic advisor and the physics department chair; you make this department what it is and it shows.

And last but certainly not least, thank you to Professor Moreno. Through the good and the bad, the over-enthusiasm and the debilitating anxiety, you have been so supportive and understanding. It has been my pleasure and my honor work with you this year. I could not have asked for a better project, nor for a better thesis advisor.
