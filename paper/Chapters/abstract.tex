This thesis examines the variance in the size-mass ratio for low-mass galaxies within the FIREbox simulation. To find possible causes for this variance, I defined a fluffiness parameter for galaxies which represents the deviation from the size-mass ratio. I calculated the distribution of this parameter for both FIREbox and the Local Group. For FIREbox galaxies, I further compared the parameter with a galaxy's proximity to its host galaxy, its minimum proximity, and the distance to its nearest neighbor. I found that above a critical threshold of $\approx 1/5$ of the host's virial radius, there was a significant negative correlation between fluffiness and minimum proximity. This implies that the variance in fluffiness is partially caused by tidal interactions with other galaxies.
