\section{Size-mass-proximity relation}

We discovered that $\beta$ is correlation with the log of a satellite's proximity to its host galaxy. This relationship, as we will demonstrate, implies that we can include this distance as a new term in the formula for the size-mass relationship (equation \ref{equ:linear-rel}). To prove this, we will reverse engineer that equation starting from equation \ref{equ:beta}. We will begin by expressing $\beta$ in terms of $d_{min} / R_{vir}$ using the experimental results found in figure \ref{fig:beta-dmin-fit}.

\begin{equation}
    \beta = -0.18 \ln\left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)
\end{equation}

Where $-0.18$ is the slope of the line of best fit in this relationship. We can plug this into equation \ref{equ:log-log-with-beta}, giving us

\begin{equation}
    \ln \left(
        \frac{R_{50}}{1 kpc}
    \right)
    =
    \ln(a)
    + \gamma \ln \left(
        \frac{M_*}{M_\odot}
    \right)
    -0.18 \ln\left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)
\end{equation}

We take the exponent to reveal the final power law relationship.

\begin{equation}
    R_{50} = a
    \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^\gamma
    \left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)^{-0.18}
    \text{kpc}
\end{equation}

And finally, we may plug in the experimental values of $a$ and $\gamma$ (see figure \ref{fig:size-mass}). This gives us a final equation of 

\begin{equation}
    R_{50} = 0.41
    \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^{0.15}
    \left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)^{-0.18}
    \text{kpc}
\end{equation}

As we can see, a satellite's distance to its host has just as much of an influence on its radius as its mass does. 
% TODO: redo ln(a) and gamma calculation for only this subset of galaxies, this will give a better plot!


\section{Further Work}

If you compare figure \ref{fig:beta-d} and \ref{fig:beta-dmin}, you will notice a number of blue-ish datapoints that exist in only the former. They do not appear in the latter graph because there was no minimum distance data for them. Their blue color-coding indicates that they have lower amounts of dark matter ($M_{*} / M_{tot} \approx 0.6$). Additionally, they fall noticeably lower on the plot than their purple neighbors, indicating that they tend to be more compact. These galaxies likely hold an important piece of the puzzle to finding the causes of variance in diffuseness for galaxies, as well as their dark matter content. Further work should focus on these galaxies, including investigating the reason why they are considered to not have a minimum distance to their host galaxy.
