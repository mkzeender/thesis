\section{Size-mass-proximity relation}

We discovered that $\beta$ is correlation with the log of a satellite's proximity to its host galaxy. This relationship, as we will demonstrate, implies that we can include this distance as a new term in the formula for the size-mass relationship (equation \ref{equ:linear-rel}). To prove this, we will reverse engineer that equation starting from equation \ref{equ:beta}. We will begin by expressing $\beta$ in terms of $d_{min} / R_{vir}$ using the experimental results found in figure \ref{fig:beta-dmin-fit}.

\begin{equation}
    \beta = -0.18 \ln\left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)
\end{equation}

Where $-0.18$ is the slope of the line of best fit in this relationship. We can plug this into equation \ref{equ:log-log-with-beta}, giving us

\begin{equation}
    \ln \left(
        \frac{R_{50}}{1 kpc}
    \right)
    =
    \ln(a)
    + \gamma \ln \left(
        \frac{M_*}{M_\odot}
    \right)
    -0.18 \ln\left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)
\end{equation}

We take the exponent to reveal the final power law relationship.

\begin{equation}
    R_{50} = a
    \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^\gamma
    \left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)^{-0.18}
    \text{kpc}
\end{equation}

And finally, we may plug in the experimental values of $a$ and $\gamma$ (see figure \ref{fig:size-mass}). This gives us a final equation of 

\begin{equation}
    R_{50} = 0.41
    \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^{0.15}
    \left( \frac{d_{min}}{R_{vir}} \right)^{-0.18}
    \text{kpc}
\end{equation}

As we can see, a satellite's distance to its host has just as much of an influence on its radius as its mass does. 
% TODO: redo ln(a) and gamma calculation for only this subset of galaxies, this will give a better plot!


\section{Further Work}

If you compare figure \ref{fig:beta-d} and \ref{fig:beta-dmin}, you will notice a number of blue-ish datapoints that exist in only the former. They do not appear in the latter graph because there was no minimum distance data for them. Their blue color-coding indicates that they have lower amounts of dark matter ($M_{*} / M_{tot} \approx 0.6$). Additionally, they fall noticeably lower on the plot than their purple neighbors, indicating that they tend to be more compact. These galaxies likely hold an important piece of the puzzle to finding the causes of variance in diffuseness for galaxies, as well as their dark matter content. Further work should focus on these galaxies, including investigating the reason why they are considered to not have a minimum distance to their host galaxy. 

This thesis covers correlations in the FIREbox data. However, it is clear from our calculation of $\sigma_\beta$ for the Local Group that the real world holds a much greater range of diffuseness values than even FIREbox. There could be many explanations for this. Firstly, there could be some mechanism causing the tidal effects to be even more pronounced than the simulations suggest. Secondly, the higher diffuseness diversity could be caused by a higher diversity in distances between galaxies. Thirdly, there could be other variables contributing to the diffuseness. And finally, the tension could still be evidence that \lcdm\* is wrong. Further work should pursue these topics.

My results show results for proximity to a galaxy's nearest neighbor. However, given that many satellite galaxies orbit their nearest neighbor, $d$ is not orthogonal to $d_{neighbor}$. Future research should control for this to determine whether the tidal effects in a host-satellite relationship are different from those of arbitrary interactions between neighboring galaxies.

\section{Closing Remarks}

We have found that tidal interactions play a role in creating diffuse galaxies. Be it a satellite that is orbiting close to its host galaxy or simply a stray galaxy passing another, its size can be forever changed by this interaction. There are likely many undiscovered methods by which a galaxy's diffuseness can evolve over time, some of which may not be present in FIREbox, but the confirmation of tidal effects brings us one step closer to understanding the nature of low-mass galaxies.
