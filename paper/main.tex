%\begin{document} starts LaTeX looking for actual content.  Everything above this point is purely formatting.
\begin{document}

\begin{titlepage}
\begin{center}

% \vspace* creates some vertical white space on the page to make the title page look more pleasing.  \vspace would do much the same thing, but would not insert the white space if we were at the top of a fresh page.  As this is the start of the document we're obviously at the beginning of a page, so the asterisk is necessary to ensure we still put in two cm of white space.
\vspace*{2cm}

{\huge The diffuseness of low-mass galaxies in the FIREbox simulation} % \huge sets the font size.  Other options include things like \large, \Large, \small, \tiny, etc.

\vspace{2cm}

% \vfill creates an arbitrary amount of vertical white space as necessary to fill the page

\today % you might choose to set a permanent date, but \today will put in today's date
\end{center}
\end{titlepage}

% \frontmatter defines the pieces of the thesis which will use roman numerals for page numbering
\frontmatter 


% \chapter{} and/or \chapter*{} will create a chapter in your thesis.  Including the asterisk will cause the chapter to not appear in the table of contents.

% \input will reference a particular .tex file.  Here we are grabbing a file entitled Abstract stored in the folder Chapters
\chapter{Abstract}
\input{Chapters/Abstract}
\chapter{Executive Summary}
\input{Chapters/ExecutiveSummary}

\chapter{Acknowledgments}
\input{Chapters/Acknowledgments}

%\tableofcontents will create a table of contents.  By default it will include entries for any \chapter, \section, and \subsection command that appears in your thesis unless you have called the tag with an asterisk
\tableofcontents

\listoffigures

% \mainmatter defines the main body of the thesis and marks where regular numbering will begin
\mainmatter

\chapter{Introduction}
\input{Chapters/Chapter1}

\chapter{Methods}
\input{Chapters/Chapter2}

\chapter{Results and discussion}
\input{Chapters/Chapter3}

\chapter{Conclusions and future work}
\input{Chapters/Chapter4}



% \bibliographystyle tells LaTeX how you want to format your bibliography.  There are many standard formats.  apsrev is fairly typical, but feel free to explore other options if the mood strikes.  
\bibliographystyle{apsrev}

% \bibliography calls the actual file that contains your bibliographic information.  This file can be generated by hand or in an automated way using software such as BibTeX.  Either works fine, but it is worth learning to use BibTex in the long term.  Take a look at the .bib file included here if you want to get some idea of the formatting required to create a bibliogrphy file of your own.

\bibliography{references}

% the \appendix tag tells LaTeX where it should start labeling chapters with letters (denoting appendices) rather than numbers (denoting main chapters)
