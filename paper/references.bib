	abstract = {We introduce a suite of cosmological volume simulations to study the evolution of galaxies at high numerical resolution as part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. FIREbox, the principal simulation of the present suite, provides a representative sample of galaxies ({\textasciitilde}1000 galaxies with Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun at z=0) at a resolution ({\textasciitilde} 20 pc, m\_b {\textasciitilde} 6x10{\textasciicircum}4 Msun) comparable to state-of-the-art galaxy zoom-in simulations. Furthermore, FIREbox captures the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium in a fully cosmological setting (L=22.1 Mpc) thanks to its exceptionally high dynamic range ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}6) and the inclusion of multi-channel stellar feedback. Here, we focus on validating the predictions of FIREbox by comparing to observational data. We find that, at a given stellar mass (for Mstar {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5-11\} Msun), simulated galaxies have star formation rates, atomic and molecular gas masses, gas phase and stellar metallicities in broad agreement with observations. In addition, FIREbox shows that these galaxy scaling relations extend to the low mass regime (Mstar {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun) and follow a (broken) power-law relationship. Also reproduced are the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI column density distribution at z{\textasciitilde}0-5. At low z, FIREbox predicts a peak in the stellar-mass--halo-mass relation, but also a higher abundance of massive galaxies and a higher cosmic star formation rate density than observed, showing that stellar feedback alone is insufficient to reproduce the properties of massive galaxies at late times. Given its high resolution and sample size, FIREbox offers a baseline prediction of galaxy formation theory in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM Universe while also highlighting modeling challenges to be addressed in next generation galaxy simulations.},

	abstract = {The standard cold dark matter plus cosmological constant model predicts that galaxies form within dark-matter haloes, and that low-mass galaxies are more dark-matter dominated than massive ones. The unexpected discovery of two low-mass galaxies lacking dark matter immediately provoked concerns about the standard cosmology and ignited explorations of alternatives, including self-interacting dark matter and modified gravity. Apprehension grew after several cosmological simulations using the conventional model failed to form adequate numerical analogues with comparable internal characteristics (stellar masses, sizes, velocity dispersions and morphologies). Here we show that the standard paradigm naturally produces galaxies lacking dark matter with internal characteristics in agreement with observations. Using a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation and a meticulous galaxy-identification technique, we find that extreme close encounters with massive neighbours can be responsible for this. We predict that approximately 30 percent of massive central galaxies (with at least 1e11 solar masses in stars) harbour at least one dark-matter-deficient satellite (with 1e8 - 1e9 solar masses in stars). This distinctive class of galaxies provides an additional layer in our understanding of the role of interactions in shaping galactic properties. Future observations surveying galaxies in the aforementioned regime will provide a crucial test of this scenario.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01131},
	abstract = {The cuspy central density profiles of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes make them highly resilient to disruption by tides. Self-interactions between dark matter particles, or the cycling of baryons during galaxy formation, may result in the formation of a constant density core which would make haloes more susceptible to tidal disruption. We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of NFW-like "cored" subhaloes in the tidal field of a massive host, and identify the criteria and timescales for full tidal disruption. Applied to the Milky Way (MW), our results imply that the survival of MW satellites places interesting constraints on core formation. Indeed, we find that no subhaloes with cores larger than 1 per cent of their initial NFW scale radius can survive for a Hubble time on orbits with pericentres {\textless}10 kpc. A satellite like Tucana 3, with pericentre {\textasciitilde}3.5 kpc, must have a core size smaller than {\textasciitilde}2 pc to survive just three orbital periods on its current orbit. The core sizes expected in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with a velocity-independent cross section of 1 cm{\textasciicircum}2/g seem incompatible with ultra-faint satellites with small pericentric radii, such as Tuc 3, Seg 1, Seg 2, Wil 1, as these would fully disrupt in less than 10 Gyr after infall. These results suggest that many satellites have vanishingly small core sizes, consistent with CDM cusps. The discovery of further Milky Way satellites on orbits with small pericentric radii would strengthen these conclusions and allow for stricter upper limits on the core sizes implied by the survival of Milky Way satellites.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09713},
	abstract = {We present the discovery of a giant tidal tail of stars associated with F8D1, the closest known example of an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG). F8D1 sits in a region of sky that is dominated by complex and bright Galactic cirrus and it has been poorly-studied since its discovery more than 20 years ago. The tidal feature was revealed in a deep map of resolved red giant branch stars that we constructed using data from our Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey of the M81 Group. It has an average surface brightness of \${\textbackslash}mu\_g {\textbackslash}sim 32\$ mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and with our current imagery can be traced for over a degree (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 60 kpc at the distance of F8D1) to the North-East of the galaxy, pointing in the direction of the dwarf spiral NGC 2976, as well as M81. We revisit the main body properties of F8D1 using deep multiband imagery acquired with MegaCam on CFHT and measure effective radii of 1.7-1.9 kpc and central surface brightnesses of \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{0\} {\textbackslash}sim 24.7-25.7\$ mag. Assuming a symmetric feature on the other side of the galaxy, we calculate that \$30-36\$\% of F8D1's present-day luminosity is contained in the stream. We argue that the most likely origin of F8D1's disruption is a recent close passage to M81, which would have stripped its gas and quenched its star formation. As the only UDG that is close enough to allow studies at extremely low surface brightness, and the first to be unambiguously linked to tidal stripping and heating, F8D1 is of particular importance. Many or most UDGs could be the result of similar processes, with the most obvious signatures of this lurking below current detection limits.},

	abstract = {We extend the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy (UDG) abundance relation, \$N\_\{UDG\}-M\_\{200\}\$, to lower halo mass hosts \$(M\_\{200\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{11.6-12.2\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})\$. We select UDG satellites from published catalogs of dwarf satellite galaxies around Milky Way analogs, namely the Exploration of Local Volume Satellites (ELVES) survey, Satellite Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) survey, and a survey of Milky Way-like systems conducted using the Hyper-Suprime Cam. Of the 516 satellites around a total of 75 Milky Way-like hosts, we find 41 satellites around 33 hosts satisfy the UDG criteria. The distributions of host halo masses peak around \$M\_\{200\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ independent of whether the host has a UDG satellite or not. We use literature UDG abundances and those derived here to trace the \$N\_\{UDG\}-M\_\{200\}\$ relation over three orders of magnitude down to \$M\_\{200\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{11.6\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and find a best-fit linear relation of \$N\_\{UDG\} = (37{\textbackslash}pm4){\textbackslash}cdot({\textbackslash}frac\{M\_\{200\}\}\{10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{0.85{\textbackslash}pm0.07\}\$. This sub-linear slope is consistent with earlier studies of UDG abundances as well as abundance relations for brighter dwarf galaxies, excluding UDG formation mechanisms that require high-density environments. However, we highlight the need for further homogeneous characterization of UDGs across a wide range of environments to properly understand the \$N\_\{UDG\}-M\_\{200\}\$ relation.},

	abstract = {Galaxies and their dark-matter haloes have posed several challenges to the dark energy plus cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model. These discrepancies between observations and theory intensify for the lowest-mass (‘dwarf’) galaxies. ΛCDM predictions for the number, spatial distribution and internal structure of low-mass dark-matter haloes have historically been at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, but this is partially expected, because many predictions modelled only the dark-matter component. Any robust ΛCDM prediction must include, hand in hand, a model for galaxy formation to understand how baryonic matter populates and affects dark-matter haloes. In this Review, we consider the most notable challenges to ΛCDM regarding dwarf galaxies, and we discuss how recent cosmological numerical simulations have pinpointed baryonic solutions to these challenges. We identify remaining tensions, including the diversity of the inner dark-matter content, planes of satellites, stellar morphologies and star-formation quenching. Their resolution, or validation as actual problems with ΛCDM, will probably require both refining of galaxy-formation models and improving numerical accuracy in simulations.},

	abstract = {We present a suite of 15 cosmological zoom-in simulations of isolated dark matter haloes, all with masses of Mhalo ≈ 1010 M⊙ at z = 0, in order to understand the relationship among halo assembly, galaxy formation and feedback's effects on the central density structure in dwarf galaxies. These simulations are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (fire) project and are performed at extremely high resolution (mbaryon = 500 M⊙, mdm = 2500 M⊙). The resultant galaxies have stellar masses that are consistent with rough abundance matching estimates, coinciding with the faintest galaxies that can be seen beyond the virial radius of the Milky Way (M*/M⊙ ≈ 105 − 107). This non-negligible spread in stellar mass at z = 0 in haloes within a narrow range of virial masses is strongly correlated with central halo density or maximum circular velocity Vmax, both of which are tightly linked to halo formation time. Much of this dependence of M* on a second parameter (beyond Mhalo) is a direct consequence of the Mhalo ∼ 1010 M⊙ mass scale coinciding with the threshold for strong reionization suppression: the densest, earliest-forming haloes remain above the UV-suppression scale throughout their histories while late-forming systems fall below the UV-suppression scale over longer periods and form fewer stars as a result. In fact, the latest-forming, lowest-concentration halo in our suite fails to form any stars. Haloes that form galaxies with M⋆ ≳ 2 × 106 M⊙ have reduced central densities relative to dark-matter-only simulations, and the radial extent of the density modifications is well-approximated by the galaxy half-mass radius r1/2. Lower-mass galaxies do not modify their host dark matter haloes at the mass scale studied here. This apparent stellar mass threshold of M⋆ ≈ 2 × 106 − 2 × 10− 4 Mhalo is broadly consistent with previous work and provides a testable prediction of fire feedback models in Λcold dark matter.},
