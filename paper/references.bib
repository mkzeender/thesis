  abstract = {We present results from the ``Mint'' resolution DC Justice League suite of Milky Way\textendash like zoom-in cosmological simulations, which extend our study of nearby galaxies down into the ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) regime for the first time. The mass resolution of these simulations is the highest ever published for cosmological Milky Way zoom-in simulations run to z = 0, with initial star (dark matter) particle masses of 994 (17900) M{$\odot$}, and a force resolution of 87 pc. We study the surrounding dwarfs and UFDs, and find that the simulations match the observed dynamical properties of galaxies with -3 {$>$} MV {$>$} -19, and reproduce the scatter seen in the size\textendash luminosity plane for rh {$\greaterequivlnt$} 200 pc. We predict the vast majority of nearby galaxies will be observable by the Vera Rubin Observatory's coadded Legacy Survey of Space and Time. We additionally show that faint dwarfs with velocity dispersions {$\lessequivlnt$}5 km s-1 result from severe tidal stripping of the host halo. We investigate the quenching of UFDs in a hydrodynamical Milky Way context and find that the majority of UFDs are quenched prior to interactions with the Milky Way, though some of the quenched UFDs retain their gas until infall. Additionally, these simulations yield some unique dwarfs that are the first of their kind to be simulated, e.g., an H i-rich field UFD, a late-forming UFD that has structural properties similar to Crater 2, as well as a compact dwarf satellite that has no dark matter at z = 0.},

Here we investigate a class of Bimetric gravity models for their cosmological implications. We study the background expansion as well as the growth of matter perturbations at linear and second order. We use low-redshift observations from SnIa (Pantheon+ and SH0ES), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the growth (\$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}\$) measurements and the measurement from Megamaser Cosmology Project to constrain the Bimetric model. We find that the Bimetric models are consistent with the present data alongside the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. We reconstructed the `` effective dark energy equation of state" (\$\textbackslash omega\_\{de\}\$) and "Skewness" (\$S\_\{3\}\$) parameters for the Bimetric model from the observational constraints and show that the current low-redshift data allow significant deviations in \$\textbackslash omega\_\{de\}\$ and \$S\_\{3\}\$ parameters with respect to the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM behaviour. We also look at the ISW effect via galaxy-temperature correlations and find that the best fit Bimetric model behaves similarly to \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM in this regard.},

We analyse the power spectrum of the density distribution, and various components of the velocity field. We show that the disc thickness is about the average Jeans scalelength, and is mainly regulated by gravitational instabilities. From this scale of energy injection, a turbulence cascade towards small scale is observed, with almost isotropic small-scale motions. On scales larger than the disc thickness, density waves are observed, but there is also a full range of substructures with chaotic and strongly non-isotropic gas velocity dispersions. The power spectrum of vorticity in a Large Magellanic Cloud sized model suggests that an inverse cascade of turbulence might be present, although energy input over a wide range of scales in the coupled gaseous+stellar fluid could also explain this quasi-two-dimensional regime on scales larger than the disc scaleheight. Similar regimes of gas turbulence are also found in massive high-redshift discs with high gas fractions. Disc properties and ISM turbulence appear to be mainly regulated by gravitational processes, both on large scales and inside dense clouds. Star formation feedback is however essential to maintain the ISM in a steady state by balancing a systematic gas dissipation into dense and small clumps. Our galaxy simulations employ a thermal model based on a barotropic equation of state aimed at modelling the equilibrium of gas between various heating and cooling processes. Denser gas is typically colder in this approach, which is shown to correctly reproduce the density structures of a star-forming, turbulent, unstable and cloudy ISM down to scales of a few parsecs.},

In this work we compute the density profile of superfluid dark matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. We show that, depending on the fluid equation of state, the dark matter profile presents distinct power-law behaviors, which can be used to distinguish it from the standard results for collisionless dark matter.},

  abstract = {The cuspy central density profiles of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes make them highly resilient to disruption by tides. Self-interactions between dark matter particles, or the cycling of baryons during galaxy formation, may result in the formation of a constant density core which would make haloes more susceptible to tidal disruption. We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of NFW-like "cored" subhaloes in the tidal field of a massive host, and identify the criteria and timescales for full tidal disruption. Applied to the Milky Way (MW), our results imply that the survival of MW satellites places interesting constraints on core formation. Indeed, we find that no subhaloes with cores larger than 1 per cent of their initial NFW scale radius can survive for a Hubble time on orbits with pericentres {$<$}10 kpc. A satellite like Tucana 3, with pericentre \textasciitilde 3.5 kpc, must have a core size smaller than \textasciitilde 2 pc to survive just three orbital periods on its current orbit. The core sizes expected in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with a velocity-independent cross section of 1 cm\^2/g seem incompatible with ultra-faint satellites with small pericentric radii, such as Tuc 3, Seg 1, Seg 2, Wil 1, as these would fully disrupt in less than 10 Gyr after infall. These results suggest that many satellites have vanishingly small core sizes, consistent with CDM cusps. The discovery of further Milky Way satellites on orbits with small pericentric radii would strengthen these conclusions and allow for stricter upper limits on the core sizes implied by the survival of Milky Way satellites.},

Furthermore, FIREbox captures the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium in a fully cosmological setting (L=22.1 Mpc) thanks to its exceptionally high dynamic range (\textasciitilde 10\^6) and the inclusion of multi-channel stellar feedback. Here, we focus on validating the predictions of FIREbox by comparing to observational data. We find that, at a given stellar mass (for Mstar {$<$} 10\^\{10.5-11\} Msun), simulated galaxies have star formation rates, atomic and molecular gas masses, gas phase and stellar metallicities in broad agreement with observations. In addition, FIREbox shows that these galaxy scaling relations extend to the low mass regime (Mstar \textasciitilde{} 10\^7 Msun) and follow a (broken) power-law relationship. Also reproduced are the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI column density distribution at z\textasciitilde 0-5. At low z, FIREbox predicts a peak in the stellar-mass--halo-mass relation, but also a higher abundance of massive galaxies and a higher cosmic star formation rate density than observed, showing that stellar feedback alone is insufficient to reproduce the properties of massive galaxies at late times. Given its high resolution and sample size, FIREbox offers a baseline prediction of galaxy formation theory in a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM Universe while also highlighting modeling challenges to be addressed in next generation galaxy simulations.},

These simulations are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (fire) project and are performed at extremely high resolution (mbaryon~=~500\,M{$\odot$}, mdm~=~2500\,M{$\odot$}). The resultant galaxies have stellar masses that are consistent with rough abundance matching estimates, coinciding with the faintest galaxies that can be seen beyond the virial radius of the Milky Way (M*/M{$\odot$} {$\approx$} 105~-~107). This non-negligible spread in stellar mass at z~=~0 in haloes within a narrow range of virial masses is strongly correlated with central halo density or maximum circular velocity Vmax, both of which are tightly linked to halo formation time. Much of this dependence of M* on a second parameter (beyond Mhalo) is a direct consequence of the Mhalo~{$\sim~$}1010\,M{$\odot$} mass scale coinciding with the threshold for strong reionization suppression: the densest, earliest-forming haloes remain above the UV-suppression scale throughout their histories while late-forming systems fall below the UV-suppression scale over longer periods and form fewer stars as a result. In fact, the latest-forming, lowest-concentration halo in our suite fails to form any stars. Haloes that form galaxies with M{$\star$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 \texttimes{} 106\,M{$\odot$} have reduced central densities relative to dark-matter-only simulations, and the radial extent of the density modifications is well-approximated by the galaxy half-mass radius r1/2. Lower-mass galaxies do not modify their host dark matter haloes at the mass scale studied here. This apparent stellar mass threshold of M{$\star$} {$\approx$} 2 \texttimes{} 106 - 2 \texttimes{} 10- 4\,Mhalo is broadly consistent with previous work and provides a testable prediction of fire feedback models in {$\Lambda$}cold dark matter.},

We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central ({$\sim$}kpc) mass concentrations in massive (\&gt;L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.},

The distributions of host halo masses peak around \$M\_\{200\}\textbackslash sim10\^\{12\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ independent of whether the host has a UDG satellite or not.

This sub-linear slope is consistent with earlier studies of UDG abundances as well as abundance relations for brighter dwarf galaxies, excluding UDG formation mechanisms that require high-density environments.

We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400/h kpc for h=0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n({$>$}Vc)\textasciitilde{} 45(Vc/10 km/s)\^\{-1\} h\^3 Mpc\^\{-3\} for Vc in the range \textasciitilde 10-70 km/s.

Cosmological models thus predict that a halo of the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity {$>$}20 km/s and mass {$>$}3x10\^8/h Msun within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximate dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at \textasciitilde 50 km/s, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with Vc{$>$} 50 km/s is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the High Velocity Clouds observed in the Local Group, and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars due either to the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or to gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background.

Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible ``floor'' in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered.},

  abstract = {The standard cold dark matter plus cosmological constant model predicts that galaxies form within dark-matter haloes, and that low-mass galaxies are more dark-matter dominated than massive ones. The unexpected discovery of two low-mass galaxies lacking dark matter immediately provoked concerns about the standard cosmology and ignited explorations of alternatives, including self-interacting dark matter and modified gravity. Apprehension grew after several cosmological simulations using the conventional model failed to form adequate numerical analogues with comparable internal characteristics (stellar masses, sizes, velocity dispersions and morphologies). Here we show that the standard paradigm naturally produces galaxies lacking dark matter with internal characteristics in agreement with observations. Using a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation and a meticulous galaxy-identification technique, we find that extreme close encounters with massive neighbours can be responsible for this. We predict that approximately 30 percent of massive central galaxies (with at least 1e11 solar masses in stars) harbour at least one dark-matter-deficient satellite (with 1e8 - 1e9 solar masses in stars). This distinctive class of galaxies provides an additional layer in our understanding of the role of interactions in shaping galactic properties. Future observations surveying galaxies in the aforementioned regime will provide a crucial test of this scenario.},

  abstract = {Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are attractive candidates to probe cosmological models and test theories of galaxy formation at low masses; however, they are difficult to detect because of their low surface brightness. In the Local Group (LG) a handful of UDGs have been found to date, most of which are satellites of the Milky Way and M31, and only two are isolated galaxies. It is unclear whether so few UDGs are expected. We address this by studying the population of UDGs formed in hydrodynamic constrained simulations of the LG from the HESTIA suite. For a LG with mass \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm LG\}\textbackslash!\textbackslash left({$<$}2.5\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\textbackslash right)=8\textbackslash times10\^\{12\}\{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$, we predict that there are \$12\textbackslash pm3\$ UDGs (68 per cent confidence) with stellar masses \$10\^6 \textbackslash leq M\_\textbackslash ast\textbackslash, /\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\} {$<$} 10\^9\$, and effective radii \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm e\} \textbackslash geq 1.5\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm kpc\}\$, in the field of the LG, of which \$2\^\{+2\}\_\{-1\}\$ (68 per cent confidence) are detectable in the footprint of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Accounting for survey incompleteness, we find that up to 82, 90, and 100 per cent of all UDGs in the LG field would be observable in a future all-sky survey with a depth similar to the SDSS, the Dark Energy Survey, or the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, respectively. Our results suggest that there is a population of UDGs in the LG awaiting discovery.},

  abstract = {Recent zoom-in cosmological simulations have shown that stellar feedback can flatten the inner density profile of the dark matter halo in low-mass galaxies. A correlation between the stellar/gas velocity dispersion ({$\sigma$}star, {$\sigma$}gas) and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) is predicted as an observational test of the role of stellar feedback in re-shaping the dark matter density profile. In this work we test the validity of this prediction by studying a sample of star-forming galaxies at 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.0 from the LEGA-C survey, which provides high signal-to-noise measurements of stellar and gas kinematics. We find that a weak but significant correlation between {$\sigma$}star (and {$\sigma$}gas) and sSFR indeed exists for galaxies in the lowest mass bin (M* {$\sim$} 1010 M{$\odot$}). This correlation, albeit with a {$\sim$}35\% scatter, holds for different tracers of star formation, and becomes stronger with redshift. This result generally agrees with the picture that at higher redshifts star formation rate was generally higher, and galaxies at M* {$\lessequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$} have not yet settled into a disk. As a consequence, they have shallower gravitational potentials more easily perturbed by stellar feedback. The observed correlation between {$\sigma$}star (and {$\sigma$}gas) and sSFR supports the scenario predicted by cosmological simulations, in which feedback-driven outflows cause fluctuations in the gravitation potential that flatten the density profiles of low-mass galaxies.},

  abstract = {Galaxy sizes correlate closely with the sizes of their parent dark matter haloes, suggesting a link between halo formation and galaxy growth. However, the precise nature of this relation and its scatter remains to be understood fully, especially for low-mass galaxies. We analyse the galaxy-halo size relation for low-mass (\$M\_\textbackslash star \textbackslash sim 10\^\{7-9\} \{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$) central galaxies over the past 12.5 billion years with the help of cosmological volume simulations (FIREbox) from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We find a nearly linear relationship between the half-stellar mass galaxy size \$R\_\{1/2\}\$ and the parent dark matter halo virial radius \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$. This relation evolves only weakly since redshift \$z = 5\$: \$R\_\{1/2\} \{\textbackslash rm kpc\} = (0.053\textbackslash pm0.002)(R\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}/35 \{\textbackslash rm kpc\})\^\{0.934\textbackslash pm0.054\}\$, with a nearly constant scatter \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash sigma \textbackslash rangle = 0.084 [\{\textbackslash rm dex\}]\$. Whilst this ratio is similar to what is expected from models where galaxy disc sizes are set by halo angular momentum, the low-mass galaxies in our sample are not angular momentum supported, with stellar rotational to circular velocity ratios \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\} / v\_\{\textbackslash rm circ\} \textbackslash sim 0.15\$. Introducing redshift as another parameter to the GHSR does not decrease the scatter. Furthermore, this scatter does not correlate with any of the halo properties we investigate -- including spin and concentration -- suggesting that baryonic processes and feedback physics are instead critical in setting the scatter in the galaxy-halo size relation. Given the relatively small scatter and the weak dependence of the galaxy-halo size relation on redshift and halo properties for these low-mass central galaxies, we propose using galaxy sizes as an independent method from stellar masses to infer halo masses.},

  abstract = {Galaxies and their dark-matter haloes have posed several challenges to the dark energy plus cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model. These discrepancies between observations and theory intensify for the lowest-mass (`dwarf') galaxies. {$\Lambda$}CDM predictions for the number, spatial distribution and internal structure of low-mass dark-matter haloes have historically been at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, but this is partially expected, because many predictions modelled only the dark-matter component. Any robust {$\Lambda$}CDM prediction must include, hand in hand, a model for galaxy formation to understand how baryonic matter populates and affects dark-matter haloes. In this Review, we consider the most notable challenges to {$\Lambda$}CDM regarding dwarf galaxies, and we discuss how recent cosmological numerical simulations have pinpointed baryonic solutions to these challenges. We identify remaining tensions, including the diversity of the inner dark-matter content, planes of satellites, stellar morphologies and star-formation quenching. Their resolution, or validation as actual problems with {$\Lambda$}CDM, will probably require both refining of galaxy-formation models and improving numerical accuracy in simulations.},

Irrespective of their nature, these objects must subsequently have undergone hierarchical clustering, whose present scale we infer from the large-scale distribution of galaxies. As each stage of the hierarchy forms and collapses, relaxation effects wipe out its substructure, leading to a self-similar distribution of bound masses of the type discussed by Press \&amp; Schechter. The entire luminous content of galaxies, however, results from the cooling and fragmentation of residual gas within the transient potential wells provided by the dark matter. Every galaxy thus forms as a concentrated luminous core embedded in an extensive dark halo. The observed sizes of galaxies and their survival through later stages of the hierarchy seem inexplicable without invoking substantial dissipation; this dissipation allows the galaxies to become sufficiently concentrated to survive the disruption of their halos in groups and clusters of galaxies. We propose a specific model in which \$\textbackslash Omega \textbackslash simeq 0.2\$, the dark matter makes up 80 per cent of the total mass, and half the residual gas has been converted into luminous galaxies by the present time. This model is consistent with the inferred proportions of dark matter, luminous matter and gas in rich clusters, with the observed luminosity density of the Universe and with the observed radii of galaxies; further, it predicts the characteristic luminosities of bright galaxies and can give a luminosity function of the observed shape.},

F8D1 sits in a region of sky that is dominated by complex and bright Galactic cirrus and it has been poorly-studied since its discovery more than 20 years ago. The tidal feature was revealed in a deep map of resolved red giant branch stars that we constructed using data from our Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey of the M81 Group. It has an average surface brightness of \$\textbackslash mu\_g \textbackslash sim 32\$ mag arcsec\$\^\{-2\}\$ and with our current imagery can be traced for over a degree (\$\textbackslash gtrsim\$ 60 kpc at the distance of F8D1) to the North-East of the galaxy, pointing in the direction of the dwarf spiral NGC 2976, as well as M81. We revisit the main body properties of F8D1 using deep multiband imagery acquired with MegaCam on CFHT and measure effective radii of 1.7-1.9 kpc and central surface brightnesses of \$\textbackslash mu\_\{0\} \textbackslash sim 24.7-25.7\$ mag. Assuming a symmetric feature on the other side of the galaxy, we calculate that \$30-36\$\% of F8D1's present-day luminosity is contained in the stream. We argue that the most likely origin of F8D1's disruption is a recent close passage to M81, which would have stripped its gas and quenched its star formation. As the only UDG that is close enough to allow studies at extremely low surface brightness, and the first to be unambiguously linked to tidal stripping and heating, F8D1 is of particular importance. Many or most UDGs could be the result of similar processes, with the most obvious signatures of this lurking below current detection limits.},
